* Reliability, convenience, efficiency.

* No one cares how fast your program gets the wrong answer.

Even in real-time applications.

* How come no one uses the phrase developtime cost?

* Conditional compilation should be left to the build system.

* Lisp is the assembly of lambda calculus.

It is typeless, homoiconic, self-modifying code, and relies on macros. Sound familiar?
Yes, it has garbage collection, but that's the only sensible response to economic pressures, whereas assembly can choose not to garbage collect its finite tape.

* If you don't do enough testing, you'll still find the bugs, but only at the end.
