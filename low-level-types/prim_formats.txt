a useful thing to have for performance control to have types for cahce lines:
	cache_L1_t, cache_L2_t, ...
probably no use as data
we can divide cache_line_Lx_t by the size of an object to find the best (minimal factor of) block size
it means your binary is tailored to a cache size, other archs will suffer performance-wise
	but that's just it: the cach is part of the documented architecture!
then again, cache-oblivious algos...
